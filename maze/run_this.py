"""
Reinforcement learning maze example.

Red rectangle:          explorer.
Black rectangles:       hells       [reward = -1].
Yellow bin circle:      paradise    [reward = +1].
All other states:       ground      [reward = 0].

This script is the main part which controls the update method of this example.
The RL is in RL_brain.py.
